# lithium
lithium is a library of module scripts organized to create UI only by code.

### creating with lithium
lithium creates buttons, selectors, and input UI objects from their modules, and takes a props table

note: you can use lithium to create "normal" non plugin UI as lithium does not automatically theme the objects based on studio theme
